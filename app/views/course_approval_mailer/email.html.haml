                  Your course page is now live! That means that when you're ready to begin
                  the assignment, your students can both create their Wikipedia accounts
                  and enroll on the page with the following link:
                %p.paragraph
                  %a.link{href: @enroll_link}= @enroll_link
                %p.paragraph
                  Please be sure to distribute this link to them early on so they
                  can get a head start on learning the ins and outs of Wikipedia,
                  and so you can begin tracking their progress.

                  In addition to myself, you'll be working with one of our Wikipedia Experts.
                  You can reach out to either of us using the "Get Help" button on your course
                  page.
